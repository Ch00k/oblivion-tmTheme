# Oblivion TextMate and Sublime 2 Theme

A port of the GEdit 'Oblivion' theme for TextMate and Sublime 2.  This is mostly styled after the [eclipsecolorthemes.org](http://www.eclipsecolorthemes.org/?view=theme&id=1) implementation.  There is an alternate implementation which is more true to the original, [Morrowind](https://github.com/NateStedman/morrowind), which may interest you.

## Installation

To install the theme, navigate to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/weak/oblivion-tmTheme "Color Scheme - Oblivion"
    
**Note**: Based on OS, the `Packages` directory can be found in the following directories:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages`
- **OS X**: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2`
- **Linux**: `~/.Sublime Text 2`

## Using the Theme

After installing the theme, it can be enabled by navigating to: `Preferences > Color Theme > Color Scheme - Oblivion > Oblivion`

## Issues

There are some color inconsistencies with this theme and the original that are still being hammered out.  For the most part, this theme was prepared quickly in an afternoon.  Please do not hesitate to report issues / create pull requests.
